When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository to allow collaborators to contribute to code, or to have it stored on a
remote server for backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Pushing changes rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date avoids having changes to the remote overwrite or interfere with your local changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Use a fork to copy a project within github to another project within github. Use a clone to copy from github to a local version, or within local repositories, when you need a working copy. Use branches when you think you may want to merge changes back in with the main code base.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Can be beneficial for planning to merge, or having an offline copy while you are working on changes that may need to be merged back in with the main code base.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would collborate using Google Docs. This would be easier at first because I wouldn't have to learn Git, but it would be much harder to track changes and agree on conflicts as the project got more complex.
